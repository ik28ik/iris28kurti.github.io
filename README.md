##### Web Design - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

This repo contains homework from the HTML & CSS lecture series from The Columbia Engineering Data Analytics Boot Camp.

I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I have created in a past (API-Challenge repo). 

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also a landing page, where you can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where you can view the data used to build them.
